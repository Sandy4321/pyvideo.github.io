networking devices! To form the Internet as we know it, each provider
network has to be managed, maintained and interconnected. Traditional
Network Engineering is moving more and more towards automated device and
service management, a task often performed in Python due to the
availability of many useful libraries. This talk will walk you though
common tasks in Network Engineering and introduce a number of Python
libraries that are helpful in accessing and managing networking
equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
